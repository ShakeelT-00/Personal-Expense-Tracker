# Expense Tracker
================

A simple command-line based expense tracking application.

## Features

* Add expenses
* View expenses
* Save and exit

## Usage

1. Run the application using `python main.py`
2. Follow the prompts to add, view, or save expenses

## Code Structure

The application is structured into the following functions:

* `load_expenses()`: Loads expenses from storage (currently a placeholder)
* `add_expense(expenses)`: Adds a new expense to the list (currently a placeholder)
* `view_expenses(expenses)`: Displays the list of expenses (currently a placeholder)
* `save_expenses(expenses)`: Saves the list of expenses to storage (currently a placeholder)
* `main()`: The main application loop

## Notes

* The current implementation does not persist data and is intended as a starting point for further development.
* The `load_expenses()`, `add_expense()`, `view_expenses()`, and `save_expenses()` functions are currently placeholders and do not perform any actual operations.
